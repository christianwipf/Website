	<p>I am a monetary macroeconomist with a special focus on banking and financial economics. 
	In particular I am interested in payment systems and the role of banks in the money supply, the macro-implications of narrow banking and CBDC proposals, 
	optimal long-run inflation targets, financial stability, and the quantity theory and inflation prediction.
