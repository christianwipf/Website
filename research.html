  <h2>Should Banks Create Money?</h2>
  
 <p>The paper compares the welfare properties of the current fractional
reserve banking (FB) system versus a narrow banking (NB) system where
deposits are fully backed by reserves. The analysis shows that under
sufficient competition FB is beneficial compared to NB because of higher
interest payments on deposits. Since under FB deposits fund loans, banks
have a higher income on their asset side which – if competition is sufficiently
high – they pass on to deposit holders in the form of higher interest.
This improves welfare because it compensates the deposit holders against
inflation. A calibrated version of the model suggests however that the
welfare gains of FB are relatively small, below 0.16% of yearly GDP in
the US between 1984 and 2008 <p>
