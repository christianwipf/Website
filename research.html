 <h2>Should Banks Create Money?</h2>
  
 <p> The paper compares the welfare properties of the current fractional reserve banking (FB) system versus a narrow banking (NB) system where 
deposits are fully backed by reserves. The analysis shows that under sufficient competition FB is beneficial compared to NB because of higher
interest payments on deposits. Since under FB deposits fund loans, banks have a higher income on their asset side which – if competition is sufficiently
high – they pass on to deposit holders in the form of higher interest. This improves welfare because it compensates the deposit holders against inflation. 
A calibrated version of the model suggests however that the welfare gains of FB are relatively small, below 0.16% of yearly GDP in the US between 1984 and 2008. <p>

 <h2>Liquidity, the Mundell-Tobin Effect, and the Friedman Rule</h2> with Lukas Altermatt, revise and resubmit <i>European Economic Review</i>
  
 <p> We investigate how a positive relation between inflation and capital investment (the Mundell-Tobin
effect) changes optimal monetary policy in a framework that combines overlapping generations and
new Monetarist models. We find that inflation rates above the Friedman rule are optimal if and
only if there is a Mundell-Tobin effect. In the absence of the Mundell-Tobin effect, the Friedman
rule is optimal. With a Mundell-Tobin effect, increasing inflation above the Friedman rule leads
to a first-order welfare gain from increasing capital investment, and only to a second-order welfare
loss from reducing consumption in markets where liquidity matters. We also show that different
implementations of the Friedman rule have different welfare implications. <p>

 <h2>Opaqueness and Optimal Intermediary Financing</h2> with Kumar Rishabh
  
 <p> In recent decades bank loan portfolios strongly shifted from business loans to mortgages which
are arguably easier to value or less "opaque" than business loans. Against this background we
study the optimal financing structure for opaque and less opaque assets, especially the use of
demandable versus non-demandable liabilities. We show that while demandable liabilities can be
optimal to finance opaque assets -- in line with the existing literature on the disciplining role of
demandable debt -- less opaque assets like mortgages or securities should be financed with nondemandable
liabilities. Empirically we document a small but positive correlation between opaque
business loans and uninsured demandable liabilities in US bank balance sheet data for
small and medium sized banks, but no correlation for lager banks. <p>
